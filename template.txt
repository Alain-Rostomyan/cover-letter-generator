Dear ___________,
As a graduate of a multicultural upbringing, the driving motivators behind my actions are to imbue a positive impact on the people and the environment around me. Bearing the culture shocks that came with having to move to new countries every 3 or so years enabled the interest which led me to pursue my past volunteer, academic, and professional experiences which aim to produce a human impact. The ability to enact these positive changes is best seen in the ______ industry, which is why I think ________ is the perfect next step in my journey to make an impact.
My desire to work for _________ comes from the fact that impact is the primary focus. The idea of learning from a leading organisation in the realm of _________ is a very humbling and enticing opportunity. An opportunity that I think, with my experience in ________ coupled with my _________, I would thrive in. I feel that this role matches my interest in understanding how _______ can be leveraged to design solutions in ________. Additionally, having lived in 8 countries spanning 2 continents, __________’s commitment to a multicultural nature through _______ further entices me to pursue this working environment.
I believe I would be a great fit for _________ for the following three reasons. First, my background in ________. From my academics, my studying in the CentraleSupélec and ESSEC Business School’s undergraduate programme in AI, data, and management lends itself perfectly for this kind of role which involves ________ as well as __________. Professionally, I have put this education into practice in my work with non-profit organisations like National Geographic where I conducted exploratory data analysis on fresh water statistics in Armenia and synthesised graphic outputs using python. Or with The Borgen Project, a nonprofit based in the US focussed on lobbying for foreign aid, where I worked with datasets to help manage outreach to university campuses across the country.
Secondly, for my accelerated learning pace and adaptability. Having lived in 8 countries across 2 continents, the culture shocks imbued me with the skill of adaptability. In the ______ field and specifically in _______, the ability to learn quickly is essential as innovations occur quickly and the knowledge tends to compound on itself. My aptitude for learning and adaptability will guarantee that I can contribute to the projects I’ll be assigned to and create high-quality results. On top of that, I have a genuine passion for problem solving in a ______ environment and love the process of working to build a solution to given problems.
Lastly, for my strong social skills, ability to thrive in team-working environments, and my diverse background. Having collaborated with multicultural teams in both academic and professional contexts, I have developed exceptional interpersonal and communication skills that allow me to navigate and contribute effectively to diverse environments. For my case study on Armenian fresh water conservation efforts for National Geographic, I was able to collaborate with local communities and bolster climate conservation efforts and my ability to fluently speak Russian and Armenian further enhanced communications. Communication skills are a vital quality in any team-working setting and I think my ability to foster a supportive yet efficient environment would be useful in this ________.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
_________
